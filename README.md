# Week 5 – Data Structures

Part of CS50x 2025 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week introduced fundamental data structures and how they are implemented in C. We explored linked lists, hash tables, trees, and how to choose the right structure for the task.

## Topics Covered
- Linked lists (singly, doubly)
- Hash tables
- Trees (binary search trees, tries)
- Structs and memory layout

## Project
- Speller

## Key Takeaways
- Learned to build and manipulate dynamic data structures.
- Understood how data structures affect performance and scalability.
- Gained experience with using malloc, free, and managing memory leaks.

## Challenges
Implementing a dictionary with a hash table and achieving good performance was tricky. Debugging memory allocation and leaks required careful use of tools like valgrind.

## How to Run
make speller
